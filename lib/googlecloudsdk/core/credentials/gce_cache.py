  Checking if we are on GCE is done by issuing an HTTP request to a GCE server.
  Since HTTP requests are slow, we cache this information. Because every run
  of gcloud is a separate command, the cache is stored in a file in the user's
  gcloud config dir. Because within a gcloud run we might check if we're on GCE
  multiple times, we also cache this information in memory.
  A user can move the gcloud instance to and from a GCE VM, and the GCE server
  can sometimes not respond. Therefore the cache has an age and gets refreshed
  if more than _GCE_CACHE_MAX_AGE passed since it was updated.
